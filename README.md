I built this file converter for a specific process, basically to learn.  I have a DMM that will data log and output to csv or txt.  my goal was to build a program with an installer to
convert / add headers / rename headers / delete duplicates and pretty much anything else I can come up with going forward. 

This is completely opensouce and feel free to do with it as you feel.
